OpenHEXA
========

OpenHEXA is an open-source data integration platform developed by [Bluesquare](https://bluesquarehub.com).

Its goal is to facilitate data integration and analysis workflows, in particular in the context of public health projects.

OpenHEXA allows you to:

1. Create **workspaces** to group code, data and users
2. Upload and read files from a **shared filesystem**
3. Write and read to a PostgreSQL **database**
4. Use Jupyter **notebooks** to explore and analyze data
5. Run and schedule complex data workflows using **data pipelines**
6. Manage your team members
